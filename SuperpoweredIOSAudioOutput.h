/**
 @brief Output channel mapping for the MultiRoute audio session category.
 
 This structure maps the channels you provide in the audio processing callback to the appropriate output channels.
 
 You can have more than a single stereo output with the MultiRoute audio session category, if a HDMI or USB audio device is connected (it doesn't work with other, such as wireless audio accessories).
 
 @em Example:
 
 
 Let's say you have four output channels, and you'd like the first stereo pair on USB 3+4, and the other stereo pair on the iPad's headphone socket.
 
 1. Set deviceChannels[0] to 2, deviceChannels[1] to 3.
 
 2. Set USBChannels[2] to 0, USBChannels[3] to 1.
 
 @em Explanation:
 
 
 - Your four output channels are having the identifiers: 0, 1, 2, 3.
 
 - The iPad (and all other iOS device) has just a stereo built-in channel pair. This is represented by deviceChannels, and (1.) sets your second stereo pair (2, 3) to these.
 
 - You other stereo pair (0, 1) is mapped to USBChannels. USBChannels[2] represents the third USB channel.
 
 @since The MultiRoute category is available in iOS 6.0 and later.
 
 @param deviceChannels The iOS device's built-in output channels.
 @param HDMIChannels HDMI output channels.
 @param USBChannels USB output channels.
 @param numberOfHDMIChannelsAvailable Number of available HDMI output channels.
 @param numberOfUSBChannelsAvailable Number of available USB output channels.
 @param headphoneAvailable Something is plugged into the iOS device's headphone socket or not.

/**
 @brief Input channel mapping for the MultiRoute audio session category.
 
 Similar to the output channels, you can map the input channels for the multiroute category. It works with USB only.
 
 Let's say you set the channel count to 4, so RemoteIO is able to provide you 4 input channel buffers. Using this struct, you can map which USB input channel appears on the specific buffer positions.
 
 @since The MultiRoute category is available in iOS 6.0 and later.

 @param USBChannels Example: set USBChannels[0] to 3, to receive the input of the third USB channel on the first buffer.
 @param numberOfUSBChannelsAvailable Number of USB input channels.
